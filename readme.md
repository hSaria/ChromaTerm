# About
ChromaTerm-- (CT--) is a process-wrapper that highlights any output according to user-configurable rules.

## Screenshots
Some quick examples. CT-- uses Regex to find matches according to your rules.

# Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/hSaria/ChromaTerm--.git
cd ChromaTerm--/src/ && ./configure && make install
```

> You must have [PCRE2](https://pcre.org) development installed. You can install with one of the following (depends on platform):
> - `brew install pcre2`
> - `apt install libpcre2-dev`
> - `yum install pcre2-devel`

> The `install` parameter is optional; it will copy `ct` to /usr/local/bin

> You can uninstall `ct` by running `make uninstall`


# Usage
- Simply type `ct` and you'll be in a shell which is wrapped by CT--.

While running, type `%` after a **new line** (`\n`) then follow it with a command. For a list of available commands:
```
%commands
```


## Commands
Below are quick summaries for some of the important commands.

> All commands are autocompleted to the closest match and case-insensitive.

#### `%highlight {condition} {action} {priority}` and `%unhighlight {condition}`
Output from the child process is scanned according to the `{condition}`. Any text that matches the condition will be highlighted with the specified `{action}`.
```
%highlight {(\d{2}:){2}[\d{2}} {bold green}
%highlight {(E|e)rr..} {<fca>}
```
The first will highlight "dd:dd:dd" bold green (d for digit). The second will highlight Err or err, and the following two characters. CT-- uses a **Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions** engine.

You can remove a rule by using `%unhighlight`.
```
%unhighlight {(E|e)rr..}
```

You can globally toggle highlighting by using `%config highlight <on|off>`.

> The highlight rules can be sorted using the optional `{priority}` parameter. Smaller value is higher in the list.

#### `%read {file}` and `%write {file}`
You can read a configuration file while inside a session. Commands will be **merged** with any existing ones. Additionally, you can write the configuration of the current session to a file.

#### `%exit`
Exits CT--. The child process is terminated, too. `%quit` does the same thing.

## Configuration File
At launch, CT-- will look for a configuration file called `.chromatermrc` in the current working directory (`pwd`) then your home directory. It will load the CT-- commands from the first one it finds.

You may also override which configuration file is loaded by using the `-c` parameter. For example:
```
ct -c $HOME/.config/ChromaTerm--/myAwesomeFirewall
```

> There is a sample file in the project. Feel free to use it.
